# Protein_Classification

Protein sequences in the fasta file are embedded using pretrained protBert, and classified as Antibiotic Resistant(and variants) and Non Resistant categories using a Multioutput classification head.

Multi class classification evaluation metrics like precision, recall and accuracy are used to evaluate the model performance.
